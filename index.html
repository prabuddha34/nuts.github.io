        <p>It’s amazing how you can visit a particular place innumerable times and yet you keep </p>
        <p>finding new surprises. Or maybe it’s just me! So, I was walking along the Camel back </p>
        <p>road again this morning and I noticed - there is this particular house on the valley side </p>
        <p>which has got a life-size chess board decorated on its terrace! So, each of the pieces </p>
        <p>are at least 3-4 feet in height, so I assume you would have to carry them over to play </p>
        <p>your moves. How cool is that! Even though I have walked almost daily on this road, for </p>
        <p>the past fortnight, I still love it. Hence followed another walk down the same road this</p>
        <p>evening. I was just aimlessly strolling on the Mall road and suddenly met Dhruv. Had a </p>
        <p>quick Chick-Chocolate special Spanish hot chocolate with him. Then I went on to enjoy </p>
        <p>my solitude and found myself slurping up a wild mushroom soup whilst looking over the </p>
        <p>valley. I was back in the Camel back road. Again. Every time, a new bird, a new flower, </p>
        <p>a new tree or even a new house definitely welcomes me here. A tiny monkey hanging </p>
        <p>from the electric wire made me laugh out loud this time.</p>

<p id="oak"> A silent promise to the whispering Oak</p>    
<br>
<br>
<p>And even if there is nothing new; even if it is the same snow peaks in the horizon, the</p>
<p>same old oaks, the same curvey valley, I am still equally amazed. The big tower from </p>
<p>the top of Landour looks down on me, the Nag tibba peak calls out...I feel wistful...I'm </p>
<p>sitting in the Hawa Mahal now and I realise, I have fallen in love with everything in this </p>
<p>little town of Mussoorie - the queen of the hills. It has started growing on me and I don't</p>
<p>want to leave! I was sat on the terrace this afternoon, soaking in the warm sun, looking </p>
<p>at the swirly roads, smiling at the overpour of greens and the restless chirping, counting </p>
<p>the quiet blessings of the mountains and I knew I can’t say goodbye…</p>
