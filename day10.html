        <p>As I walked back to the cottage in the dark, I stopped, struck in awe. The moon is </p>
        <p>crescent shaped today. A thin crisp glowing white outlines the bottom half of the moon. </p>
        <p>But if you just stare at the moon for a few seconds longer, the entire circular shape of </p>
        <p>the moon is visible under an uncanny misty dark gray shadow. It’s as if clearly letting</p>
        <p>you know - that it’s there, the full circle of it and it's keeping an eye from behind the veil.</p>
        <p>Maybe, this is how it always looks like but I have never noticed before. And I stood </p>
        <p>there marveling at this moony hide-n-seek whilst the chilly night grew chillier.</p>

    <p id="black">While walking on the Camel Back Road,
        where a carpet of rhododendrons adorned the path
        & I also spotted the blue-throated green barbet..!</p>
        <p>It’s amazing the things that you notice when you pause or slow down for a bit. And </p>
        <p>hence, walking definitely is the slowest and yet the most pleasurable experience. Well, I </p>
        <p>hate driving (also I can’t drive), so I am biased - I confess. But even then, you can’t </p>
        <p>deny the magical revelations you have when you walk. Like this crescent moon’s full </p>
        <p>shape in the dark or the bright green blue-throated bird (blue-throated barbet) at the top </p>
        <p>of the tree that I noticed when I was walking by the Camel Back road, yet again. I stood </p>
        <p>by the railing and kept watching the bird as he kept shaking his neck sideways and up </p>
        <p>and down. A couple walked by, smiling at me sympathetically - like I’m either lost or </p>
        <p>retarded. Well, I am both, so I don’t mind.</p>

            My phone struggling at it's very poor attempt of clicking a snap of the barbet</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>As I entered the cottage, bidding a goodnight to the moon, Doodle greeted me, wagging </p>
            <p>his tail rapidly, with his two fluffy hands holding on to my knees. As I walked in, he kept </p>
            <p>holding on to my legs and got dragged in with my feet. Awh, the sweet thing. I never </p>
            <p>knew I could get so mushy by a dog’s wagging tail</p>
