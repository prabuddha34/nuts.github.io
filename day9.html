    <p>Jabarkhet Nature reserve echoed with a musical duet performance by a barbet and a</p>
    <p>cuckoo as I stepped into ‘The Hut’ that served as the main point of entrance to this </p>
    <p>private forest reserve. It's a little hut made of stones. Vipul Bhai and Rajinder Bhai (who</p>
    <p>walks 10 KM each way on this hilly terrain every day from his home to work here!!) take </p>
    <p>care of this place along with a few of their friends; they serve tea and other </p>
    <p>refreshments to the visitors and also guide them to the forest trails that diverge from this</p>
    <p>hut.</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>There were many paths to choose from - Leopard trail, Ridge trail, Rhododendron trail,</p>
    <p>Mushroom trail, Wildflower trail. Mushroom trail immediately captured my attention. I </p>
    <p>love mushrooms in any form! But too bad, it's best viewed in monsoons. I followed the </p>
    <p>steps of my guide, Rohit (who agreed to bear with me again this weekend after our last </p>
    <p>weekend’s Top Tibba trek) and we leisurely started with the Leopard trail.</p>

    <p id="black">Starting with the Leopard Trail...</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>The long trees give a thrilling vibe to the forest. There was a cluster of variety all around </p>
    <p>- long, coarse oaks, stylish rhododendrons, furry pines, barberry shrubs, reddish </p>
    <p>boxwoods, gnarly Layonia and so many others!

<br>
<br>
<p>We cut across the Leopard trail and moved to the Ridge trail at one point. The path </p>
<p>twisted and turned, softly and steadily moving up to the top most point of this reserve - </p>
<p>The Flag Hill top. From this point, the Himalayan snow wall which has been my friend</p>
<p>every day of this trip now, was once again, clearly visible. Thanks to Rohit, we even had </p>
<p>a binocular today. Through the lenses, I took a longer and clearer peek at my favorite </p>
<p>Bandarpunch, Swargarohini along with Srikanta and Yamonatri and several others.</p>
