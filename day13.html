    <p>Winter was at its fag end when I had arrived. And Spring was kinda creeping in. As I sit </p>
    <p>on the terrace now, I see the pink and white blossoms have taken quite a character. </p>
    <p>Spring is not yet at its full bloom but it has certainly arrived with a grandeur. Just from </p>
    <p>the terrace itself, I can see a number of finches, songbirds, barbets flying around with </p>
    <p>their gorgeous wings. The white and purple and fluorescent butterflies have joined them </p>
    <p>as well.</p>

<p>It's a mixed feeling today. I want to go home and be lazy but I want to go to Landour too </p>
<p>and walk around till my legs throb. I want to sleep in my own bed but I want to watch the </p>
<p>quirky creatures in the Camel Back road too. I want mom made food but I want the</p>
<p>yummy bakery too. I want too much! :D</p>

   <p>My right knee is extremely sore from the last few days of marathon walks. Itâ€™s a rest day </p>
   <p>with a crazy work schedule. Unlucky 13 it is. Home calling and yet, a heavy heart still </p>
   <p>seems to wander around...</p>
