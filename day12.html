        <p>I woke up a bit late than usual (courtesy Dhruv's bidding-goodbye movie late last night). Rajesh</p>
        <p>knocked on the door, with sleep in his eyes, 'ma'am chai?' A dearie, he is. I had told him off the</p>
        <p>other day because he was late and Mussoorie mornings are not the same without Rajesh's</p>
        <p>special ginger tea. The Sun was at its full strength today, basking the streets of Mussoorie with a</p>
        <p>vibrant energy. I found myself walking towards Landour, again.</p>

        <p id="black">Mussoorie Mall road in the morning...</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>As I was climbing up the initial steep of the road, my eyes were drawn to a sudden swift</p>
<p>movement in a corner of a oak. I strained my eyes to observe but there was absolute stillness. I</p>
<p>could see nothing but the oak and it's leaves. I took a couple of steps further and again there was</p>
<p>a flutter. I stood very still now and watched. A little owlet sat in one of the branches! He looked</p>
<p>very sleepy and comfortable. Ah, the sweet sweet thing. He fluttered his neck a little again and</p>
<p>then fell into a stillness. Maybe, he's dreaming, who knows!</p>

<br>
<p>I took the path straight to the bakehouse today. I was craving for their bakery items and nothing</p>
<p>beats a good brunch. Needless to say, I ate like a pig! I shook off any sneaky feeling of regret by</p>
<p>thinking, 'well I'm walking real long distances each day. I need calories.' Whatever makes you</p>
<p>happy, really! If you are a foody pig like me, do check out this fabulous article - Landour's food</p>
<p>culture!. It has every gastronomical gems you might be looking for!</p>

<br>
<p>I, now, know all the popular trees and the flowers in the area - buraansh (rhododendron), banjh</p>
<p>(oak), chir (pine) and as I was taking pride in it, a bunch of reddish-orange spiky flowers</p>
<p>appeared at the next turn, bursting my pride-bubble. I asked a local if he knew the name. He</p>
<p>smiled and nodded a negative. I guess there's a charm in not knowing as well. You see, whatever</p>
<p>makes you happy ;)</p>
