        <p>This is more like a backlog blog post coupled with today’s shenanigans! Last couple of days were all crazy with work - I woke up, logged in for work and logged off - Yup! That pretty much summed it up! Suffice to say - worst days ever till now. But the flip side to this was - I not only made friends with some fun people who are staying in this cottage but also learnt some bhangra and garhwali dance moves - two classic talents in my repertoire now! A very sweet couple - Honey and Dipangshu rocked the evenings with their bhangra moves and our very dear caretaker, Rajesh swooned the floor with his slow-motion Garhwali moves. Another friend, Dhruv imparted some good Rajasthani foody tips, mostly involving different types of Kachori, not to forget Supriya and her jumpy dog - Berlin who played along the whole time. Kamini Aunty cheered us on whilst cooking dinner for us and her sweet teddy dog - Doodle ran amongst us, confused at all this commotion! The Friday evening ended with a bitter after-work exhaustion but the night ended with a lot of bhangra cardio, cleansing the tiredness and the sore neck I got from working all day in bed! Anyway, next few days of no-work now and I went to bed thinking - Let’s see on which side of the topsy curvy life I find myself tomorrow…</p>

 <p id="black">Next morning be lit up as this Night!</p>
        <p>It’s Saturday morning and I woke up full of energy. A quick freshening up and I set off with one of my new friends from this cottage, Dhruv about 7:30 in the morning. From our little tucked in Stella cottage (Oh and I discovered that the house which was struck by the cannonball from Gun Hill, I mentioned in one of my last posts - is none other than the Stella cottage I am staying in! How uncanny!), we started to walk past the Library Chowk and took the way to the right from the forked road there. Destination - George Everest top. </p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The scene changed instantly. The valley opened up offering a glimpse of the snow-capped Himalayan range. The walk was a serene experience, the morning was calm and quiet, the flowers peeked from here and there, the leaves rustled in the soft wind and we walked on…</p>

    <p>Turns out, we both - two strangers from two very different parts of the country - are equally interested in the funny green leaves and pretty colorful flowers and chirpy singing birds. The walk took its own interesting pace as we stopped to debate and google and browse through a fauna catalog to figure out the differences between - chir pine and blue pine and deodar. The cutesy pinkish Mussoorie flowers (after which the place is named) greeted with a sly sweet smile, the bright red rhododendrons burst out amidst the thick greens, sometimes from the top of the slopes, sometimes - from the bottom of the valleys, the violet and yellow tiny flowers peeked from the corners.</p>
