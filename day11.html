        <p>It is a love story - every time, every season, every moment Iâ€™m in Landour. I have been </p>
    <p>to Landour before and I was in Landour today and I will be in Landour again. I know I </p>
    <p>have a piece of my heart tucked in those whispering oaks and long slender deodars</p>
    <p>the steady slopes and the lonely turns, the rustling leaves and the soft gentle breeze, </p>
    <p>the chirping birds and the cheeky monkeys. I know I have a piece of my heart tucked in </p>
<p>those hilly swirly paths of Landour and I know a piece of this place is tucked deep inside </p>\
<p>my heart.</p>

<p id="black">Just doing what I love best...idle strolls :)</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>I have been to quite a few places, have fell into a whirlwind of adrenaline rush and </p>
<p>romance in those high snowy slopes of the Kedarkantha, have been charmed by the</p>
<p>mystical flowers in the Valley of Flowers, have felt acutely spiritual standing in front of </p>
<p>the mighty Annapurna massif, have felt magical getting lost in the European lanes and </p>
<p>etc. etc. But when I come to Landour, it's like a sweet subtle love story woven between </p>
<p>those gnarly barks of the trees, the homely flowers in the corners and the serene tree </p>
<p>shade in every turn of the clean brick path. It reminds me of the South Downs Hills in </p>
<p>England, for some reason. Even though there is no practical similarity between the two </p>
<p>places, I guess the feeling is the same - cozy, comfortable, undaunting, sweet love.</p>

    Just be :)</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>I walked around Landour, mostly tracing similar paths I have been before</p>
    <p> but at times sneaking into a few unexplored lanes (got warned by a</p>
    <p>growling dog when I almost started walking into the Doordarshan TV tower campus)</p>
    <p>sometimes watching the little birds which are at abundance at the start of this spring </p>
    <p>(got watched by a bunch of red-bottom monkeys in return), sometimes getting lost and </p>
    <p>wandering off to a nearby village (got back in the right track with a help of a patrolling </p>
    <p>army officer), sometimes sat with a coffee looking at the snowy Siwalik range doing </p>
    <p>nothing, sometimes smiling at the new blossoms and the big trees (do you ever think of </p>
    <p>Deodar as a tree sprawling its many hands as if trying to maximise the surface area for</p>
    <p>soaking warmth?), sometimes just stopping and listening to the trees whisper in the soft </p>
    <p>breeze and sometimes just pausing to let the big Langur cross the way.</p>
